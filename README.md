# Presence-Management-System
The objective of this web application is to make attendance management easier for teachers.  
Each teacher has a user account on the web application.    
In order to perform basic tasks and to ensure the smooth running of the application, it is managed by an administrator.  
By logging in to his account, the teacher can call for a session (for a group) and record the attendance record on the application instead of writing it down on a sheet. He can also consult the attendance record of previous sessions.
